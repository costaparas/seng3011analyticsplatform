- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB_Limited#Oil_for_food_scandal
- The government-sanctioned Cole Inquiry into the company's role in the scandal has been completed and was tabled by Attorney-General Philip Ruddock on 27 November 2006. The report found that, from mid-1999, AWB had knowingly entered into an arrangement that involved paying kickbacks to the Iraqi government, in order to retain its business. The Inquiry recommended that 12 people be investigated for possible criminal and corporations offences over the scandal.
- In the years immediately following the Cole Inquiry, AWB continued to be dogged by bad performance.The company remains liable in several civil cases being completed, and has not always been successful in its attempts to find new markets.
- Despite making a small profit in 2009, in March 2010, the company announced a profit downgrade from domestic trading activities.In May 2010, it reported a half-year loss of $64.8 million, which it claimed due to the cost of settling the shareholder class action for $39.5m, and a loss of $65.4m on restructuring costs associated with its sale of the Landmark Financial Services loan and deposit books.
- In 2010, AWB accepted a takeover bid from Agrium at A$1.50 a share, or $1.2 billion in total, which was later approved by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board.
- In 2011, Cargill Australia acquired the AWB Commodity Management business from Agrium. This follows the ACCC's decision on March 17, 2011 not to oppose the acquisition
